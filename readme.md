# 🍽️ **Swiggy Delivery Performance Analytics**

Food delivery platforms generate massive data every second — from customer orders to delivery times, traffic, weather, and profitability.
This project analyzes Swiggy’s delivery performance to uncover insights into **operations efficiency, customer behavior, profitability, and real-world business patterns**.
Using **Python, Excel, and interactive dashboards**, this project simulates analysis typically done inside food delivery companies.

---

## ❗ **Problem Statement**

Food-delivery businesses often struggle to understand the hidden factors behind delivery delays, profit loss, high cancellations, and fluctuating customer behavior.
Without proper analytics, identifying patterns related to distance, traffic, weather, and discounts becomes difficult.

This project solves that gap through structured analysis, modeling, and dashboarding to highlight the most important operational and financial insights.
